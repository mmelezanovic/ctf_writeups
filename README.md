# CTF Writeups

Since an early age, I have enjoyed puzzles such
as [the blue eyes](https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html), brainteasers
by [Martin Gardner](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/math/martin-gardners-best-math-puzzles-part-1) and
games like sudoku, picross or [towers](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/towers.html).

I also have a love for programming and computer security.  What do you get when you put them all together?

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions!  In short, a CTF is a series of challenges that can often require
knowledge of cryptography, steganography, reverse engineering, binary exploits and other security related skills.
One of the best overviews is the [Trail of bits CTF field guide](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/).

Helpful tools for solving CTFs include:

- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and various libraries including [pwn tools](https://www.python.org/)
- [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/)
- [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/)
- [radare2](http://radare.org/r/)
- [GDB PEDA](ihttps://github.com/longld/peda)
- Hex editors (I use ghex or bless)
- Diff tools (I use meld)
- A good imagination! :)

To get started I recommend the following resources tha I have found helpful:

- [Live overflow](http://liveoverflow.com/) - excellent video tutorials
- [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - helpful for sharpening your programming skills
- [pwnable.kr/](http://pwnable.kr/)
- [Over the wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- [Exploit exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/)
